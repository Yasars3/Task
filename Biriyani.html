    <h1>Hyderabadi biryani (also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani) is a style of biryani originating from the kitchens of the Nizams of the erstwhile Hyderabad State with basmati rice and meat (mostly mutton) [1]. Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine and it is so famous that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.Hyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine.Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, AsafJah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition.In 1857, when the Mughal Empiredeclined in Delhi, Hyderabad emerged as the center of South Asian culture,resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani.</h1>
